---

## Priority 1: Auth & Persistence

### Simple Login System
Basic auth for the overworld to enable data persistence.

**Purpose:**
- Persist character selection across sessions/devices
- Track Wordle stats and performance over time
- Foundation for future features (achievements, unlockables)

**Requirements:**
- Super simple - minimal friction to play
- Persist: player name, character, game stats
- Options: Supabase, simple SQLite, or JSON file storage

**Implementation Options:**
1. **Supabase** - Free tier, easy setup, built-in auth
2. **SQLite + simple API** - No external deps, self-contained
3. **JSON file per user** - Simplest, no DB needed

### Wordle Stats Tracking
Track performance metrics over time (requires auth above).

**Metrics:**
- Win rate (overall and vs specific opponents)
- Average solve time
- Average guesses per game
- Head-to-head matchup history
- Streak tracking (consecutive wins)

**Display:**
- Stats page accessible from Wordle lobby
- Personal dashboard with charts/graphs
- Leaderboard across all players

---

## Priority 2: Major Features

### Character Customization
Let players personalize their character appearance.

**Options:**
- Color palette selection (skin, outfit, accessories)
- Choose on first join or from pause menu
- Could evolve into a "store" with unlockables

**Visual:**
- Color tinting or palette swaps (simplest)
- Separate sprite sheets per color (more work, better control)
- Accessory layers (hats, items) drawn on top

---

## Priority 3: Multiplayer Optimizations

### Latency Improvements
- [ ] Client-side prediction - move locally, reconcile with server
- [ ] Delta updates - send position changes, not absolute positions
- [ ] Tick rate batching - batch updates to 20-30 Hz instead of every frame
- [ ] Compression - msgpack instead of JSON (optional)

### Reliability
- [ ] Reconnection handling - auto-reconnect on disconnect
- [ ] Connection quality indicator - show ping/latency
- [ ] Graceful degradation - continue in single-player if server dies

### Scalability
- [ ] Rooms/lobbies - multiple game instances
- [ ] Player limits per room
- [ ] Matchmaking - auto-join available rooms

---

## Future Ideas (Icebox)

### Map Editor Improvements

**Rotate Entities**
- Rotate placed entities with mouse drag or 'R' key
- Support 90° increments or free rotation
- Visual rotation handle on selected entity

**Clone Selection**
- Select a region of tiles/entities
- Copy to clipboard/palette
- Paste elsewhere on map
- Useful for repeating patterns (fences, paths, room layouts)

**Map Management from UI**
- Load/save maps without manual file copying
- Browse/select maps from a list in the editor UI
- Create new map from template with custom name
- Delete/rename maps
- Auto-save to server or localStorage
- **Choose save location** - Pick folder for local map saves (File System Access API)
- **Map naming** - Enter custom filename when saving (not just download)

**Entity List UX Fix**
- Entity list panel should scroll independently
- Currently scrolls the whole page when list is long
- Fix: `overflow-y: auto` with fixed height on entity list container

### Hub Landing Page Visual Improvements
- Replace green grass background with something more fitting (gradient, pattern, or themed graphic)
- Current grass color feels out of place for a tools hub landing page
- Consider: dark gradient, subtle grid pattern, or stylized tech-themed background

### Improved Hitbox Management
Editor or tooling for creating pixel-perfect collision shapes.

**Current state:**
- Config-based collision shapes in `config.js` (normalized coordinates)
- Supports rectangles and polygons
- Triangle roofs work well for house-1 style buildings

**Future improvements:**
- Visual hitbox editor (in-game or external tool like PhysicsEditor/Tiled)
- More complex polygon shapes for irregular buildings
- Automatic hitbox generation from sprite alpha channel

### Dynamic Depth Sorting
Allow player to walk "behind" buildings and trees for proper 2D depth illusion.

**Current behavior:**
- Player always renders on top of buildings (z-index 10 > building z-index 4)
- Full collision blocks player from entering building area

**Desired behavior:**
- Player can walk behind buildings (when "above" them in Y-space)
- Player renders behind building roof when north of building
- Player renders in front when south of building

**Implementation approaches:**
1. **Y-based z-index** - Update player z dynamically based on Y position
2. **Per-object sorting** - Compare player Y to each object's "foot" position
3. **Layered collision** - Separate roof collision (passable) from base collision (blocking)

**Complexity:** Medium-High. Requires frame-by-frame z-index updates and careful handling of overlapping objects.

### Scotty NPC
- Fast-moving character that zips around the map
- Hard to catch, rewards bonus points
- Random movement patterns

### Timed Fritelle Mode
- Competitive race to collect the most in 60 seconds
- Countdown timer
- Final scoreboard

### Minimap
- Small overview in corner
- Show player positions
- Show fritelle locations

### Achievement Popups
- Toast notifications for milestones
- First collection, 10 collected, golden catch, etc.

### Custom Voice Sounds
- Let each team member record their own sounds
- Fritelle hit reactions, voice lines, etc.
- Could use Web Audio API for recording
- Store in localStorage or server-side per player

## Code Quality Audit (Legacy Reference)

### Overview
The codebase has grown significantly. Before adding major features, conduct a comprehensive code audit to identify technical debt, improve maintainability, and establish patterns for future development.

**Scope:** ~15,000 lines across 40+ files, with `map-editor.html` (3,144 lines) being the largest single file.

### Known Issues to Address

1. **`map-editor.html` is a monolith (3144 lines)**
   - Extract: Tileset Builder → `tileset-builder.js`
   - Extract: Sprite Slicer → `sprite-slicer.js`
   - Extract: Entity management → `entity-manager.js`
   - Extract: Tile painting → `tile-painter.js`
   - Keep: Core state, rendering, event coordination

2. **Repeated piece override lookup pattern**
   - Added same 10-line pattern in 4 places
   - Extract to: `getEffectivePieces(assetId)` helper

3. **Duplicate `js/` and `server/public/js/`**
   - Options: (a) Build step to copy, (b) Symlinks, (c) Single source
   - Currently manually synced → error-prone

4. **No linting or formatting**
   - Add: ESLint + Prettier
   - Add: Pre-commit hook

### Refactoring Priorities

| Priority | Item | Impact | Effort |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Extract `getEffectivePieces()` helper | High | Low |

| 4 | Consolidate `js/` duplication | Medium | Medium |
| 5 | Add basic test infrastructure | Medium | Medium |
| 6 | Document architecture | Medium | Low |

### Audit Process

1. **Run static analysis** - ESLint with strict rules
2. **Measure complexity** - Function length, nesting depth, cyclomatic complexity
3. **Review each file** - Use checklist above
4. **Document findings** - Create issues or inline TODOs
5. **Prioritize fixes** - Impact vs effort matrix
6. **Incremental refactoring** - Fix as you touch code

### Success Criteria

- [ ] No function >100 lines
- [ ] No nesting >4 levels
- [ ] No duplicate code blocks >10 lines
- [ ] ESLint passes with zero warnings
- [ ] All public functions have JSDoc
- [ ] Architecture documented in `/docs`
- [ ] Single source of truth for `js/` files
