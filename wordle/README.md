## ⚔️ Word Selection Modes (Multiplayer)

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Daily** | Everyone solves today's official daily word |
| **Random** | Server picks a random word for all players |

## 💡 Tips

- **Sabotage strategy**: Words with double letters (EERIE, LLAMA) are harder to guess

- **Hard mode**: Great for training—forces you to use all the clues you earn
- **Streaks**: Play daily to build your streak; missing a day resets it!
